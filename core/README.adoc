== Application configuration

In Spring Fu, configuration is done via an application DSL augmented by the configuration DSL of the modules present in the classpath.

=== Beans

Beans are simply defined as follows.

```kotlin
application {
	bean<UserRepository>()
	bean<ArticleRepository>()
	bean<HtmlHandler>()
	bean<ApiHandler>()
}

```

[NOTE]
====
Beans declared as above will be autowired by constructor if needed.
====

=== Configuration

Configuration is usually done using `data` classes instantiation with environment and default values.

```kotlin
application {
	configuration {
		TestConfiguration(name = env["SYSTEM_ENV"] ?: "default")
	}
}

data class TestConfiguration(
		val name: String
)
```

=== Listeners

Declare application event Listeners in order to run tasks when `ApplicationContextEvent` like `ContextStartedEvent` or `ContextRefreshedEvent` are emitted.

```kotlin
application {
	listener<ContextStartedEvent> {
		ref<UserRepository>().init()
	}
}
```

== Guidelines

=== Constructor injection

Our recommendation is to try and favor constructor injection with `val` read-only (and non-nullable when possible) https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html[properties].

[source,kotlin]
----
class YourBean(
	private val mongoTemplate: ReactiveMongoTemplate,
	private val configuration: ApplicationConfiguration
)
----

[NOTE]
====
Classes with a single constructor have their parameters automatically autowired, that's why there is no need for an explicit `@Autowired constructor` in the example shown above.
====

=== Immutable data classes

In Kotlin, it is very convenient and considered best practice to declare read-only properties
within the primary constructor, as in the following example:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
----

You can optionally add https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html[the `data` keyword].

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
----

The compiler will automatically derive the following members from all properties declared
in the primary constructor:

* `equals()`/`hashCode`() pair
* `toString()` of the form "User(name=John, age=42)"
* `componentN()` functions corresponding to the properties in their order of declaration
* `copy()` function


This allows for easy changes to individual properties even if `Person` properties are read-only.

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
	data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

	val jack = Person(name = "Jack", age = 1)
	val olderJack = jack.copy(age = 2)
----
