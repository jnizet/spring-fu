= Dynamic configuration module

This module provides an alternative to the regular Spring Fu application configuration,
designed to allow writing configuration using Kotlin scripts
(`*.kts` files).

Instead of externalizing the configuration in properties or Yaml files, it allows externalizing
it using Kotlin Script files. These files use the same syntax as a regular statically-compiled Kotlin
configuration, and benefit from the same type-safety and auto-complete support provided by the IDE.
They are thus well suited for dynamic or remote configuration loading for example.

The main drawbacks are the size of the Kotlin compiler dependency (almost 20M) and the time, CPU
and memory required for compiling the script. That's why it is not used by default.

```kotlin
application {
	configuration("myconf.kts")
}
```
